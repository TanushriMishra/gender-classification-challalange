# gender-classification-challalange
This the gender classification challenge which was given by Siraj. To know more, you can watch his this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg .
This was the simple challenge to  use 3 models to predict whether the given measurements belonged to male or female. As an example siraj user decision tree classifier, I used the following models and this is the prediction given by them for the same data in Gender_Classification_challenge.ipynb.

Models Used	Predicted Result
Decision Tree	Male
K Nearest Neighbors	Male
support Vector machine Male
Gaussian Naive Bayes	Male

I used scilit-learn or sklearn and Python 3.6.

Also, I have defined test set as well and made predictions using the same model and I have measured their accuracy score, following are the results:

Models Used	Accuracy
Decision Tree	100%
K Nearest Neighbors	87.5%
support Vector machine 62.5%
Gaussian Naive Bayes	100%

Finished in 24 S

I found Male in all four model but accuracy was 100% only for two model Decision tree and Gaussian NB
